    'It\'s such a shame, a brilliant cast, lovely setting, obviously a huge budget... yet the story was as if a bunch of stoned teenagers suddenly said to each other, \'hey, got a great idea for a tv show\' and came up with the most ridiculous and inane script ever written. Sorry, but with all of the hype and trailers, I was hoping for so much more. Please don\'t make a second series, and spend the money on something better.',
